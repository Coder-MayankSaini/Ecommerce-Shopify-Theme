  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Welcome to TrendKartz! The terms “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to TrendKartz. TrendKartz operates this store and website, including all related information, content, features, tools, products, and services in order to provide you with a curated shopping experience (the “Services”). TrendKartz is powered by Shopify, which enables us to provide the Services to you.</p>
  <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”), together with any policies referenced herein, describe your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services. By visiting, interacting with, or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you should not use or access the Services.</p>

  <h3>Section 1 – Access and Account</h3>
  <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and that you consent to allow your minor dependents to use the Services on devices you own, purchase, or manage. You may be asked to provide accurate, current, and complete information (including email, billing, payment, and shipping details). You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials and for all account activity. Accounts may not be transferred, sold, assigned, or licensed.</p>

  <h3>Section 2 – Our Products</h3>
  <p>We strive to present accurate representations of our products, but colors and appearance can differ by device and settings. We do not warrant that products will meet your expectations. Product descriptions may change at any time. We reserve the right to discontinue products and to limit quantities for any person, region, or jurisdiction.</p>

  <h3>Section 3 – Orders</h3>
  <p>When you place an order, you make an offer to purchase. TrendKartz reserves the right to accept or decline any order. We must receive and process payment before acceptance. Review orders carefully before submitting; cancellation requests may not be possible afterward. If we decline or change your order, we will attempt to notify you using the contact details you provided. Purchases are subject to our Refund Policy. You represent that purchases are for personal or household use and not for commercial resale or export.</p>

  <h3>Section 4 – Prices and Billing</h3>
  <p>Prices, discounts, and promotions may change without notice. The price charged is the price in effect at the time of order and will be listed in your confirmation email. Prices do not include taxes, shipping, handling, customs, or import charges unless expressly stated. Prices may differ from those in physical stores or third-party channels. Promotions may have separate terms. You agree to provide current, complete purchase and payment information and to update it promptly, and you represent that you are authorized to use the provided payment method. You agree to pay all charges, including applicable taxes and fees.</p>
